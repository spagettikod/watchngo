# About
Basic utility to monitor a directory and run a command when changes
are detected.

I use it to recompile on changes when developing Go web services. Another
usage is to precompile Handlebars templates when developing web applications.

## Installation


## Usage
```watchngo goweb goweb/run.s```

See _examples for a working example recompiling and restarting a Go code when
files change.
